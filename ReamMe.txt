This is all the source code for the book: Using FPGA Modules for Data Acquisition and Control, Author: Dennis Bingaman

All the exersizes in this book will use Vivado for building the FPGA bit file and Visual Studio 2017 for building the PC side software.

For each project in this book when building the bit file, follow these instructions:

1.  From the 'VivadoXEM7001TemplateProject' folder copy the 'XEM7001Template.zip' file to a seperate directory on your computer.
2.  Unzip the file, then open the project using Vivado, specifical open the project file: XEM7001Template.xpr file.
3.  Replace the TopLevel.vhd file with the one from the chapter in the book for the specific exersize.
4.  Replace the xem7001.xdc file with the one from the chapter in the book for the specific exersize.
5.  Build the project all stages up to and including generating the bit file.

For each project in this book when building the Visual Studio PC side software, follow these instructions:

1.  From the 'VisualStudioOKFPGATemplateProject' folder copy the 'OKFPGA_USB2_0_TemplateProject.zip file to a seperate directory on your computer.
2.  Unzip the file, then open the project using Visual Studio, specifically open the project file: 'OKFPGA_USB2_0_TemplateProject.sln'
3.  Replace the App.c file with the one from the chapter in the book for the specific exersize.
4.  Copy the appropriate TopLevel.bit file from the corresponding Vivado project to this projects directory, overwriting the one that is currently here.
5.  Build the project, after this you can run the project in debug mode.
